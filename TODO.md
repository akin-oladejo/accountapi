Fixes:
1. A user should not be able to transfer to themselves
2. Account balance shouldn't be stateless (ie we should be able to track the changes)
3. Building on (2) above, the second collection should be 'transactions' not 'transfers' ie make it possible to see both
credits and debits, and consequentially changes in account balance

Todo:
1. Include instructions in README for API
2. Include instructions for dev to use Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
