Fixes:  
✅ A user should not be able to transfer to themselves  
⬜ Account balance shouldn't be stateless (ie we should be able to track the changes)  
⬜ Building on (2) above, the second collection should be 'transactions' not 'transfers' ie make it possible to see both
credits and debits, and consequentially changes in account balance

Todo:  
⬜ Include instructions in README for API  
⬜ Include instructions for dev to use Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
